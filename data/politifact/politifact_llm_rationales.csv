  4. Lack of evidence: The message does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the US is the ""highest taxed nation in the world.""

Based on these textual characteristics,",0,1," Plausibility: It is plausible that Donald Trump would make a false claim about the tax burden in the United States, as he has a history of making false statements and accusations during his presidency. It is also plausible that he would continue to make false claims about the tax burden in the United States, even after leaving office.

Verifiability: The claim that the United States is the ""highest taxed nation in the world"" can be verified through public records and data on tax rates in different countries. However, Trump has made false claims about the tax burden in the past, and it is not clear if this particular claim is supported by any credible evidence.

Source credibility: The message does not provide information about the source of the claims, but the fact that Trump has a history of making false claims about the tax burden in the United States adds to the credibility of the message.

news text: <text>According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States, and it is the second leading cause of death due to cancer. Breast cancer is caused by the growth of abnormal cells in the breasts. The cells divide and grow uncontrollably, forming a lump or mass. These abnormal cells can spread to other parts of the body and cause cancer. The growth of abnormal cells in the breasts can be caused by a variety of factors, including hormonal changes, genetic mutations, and exposure to certain chemicals. Women with breast cancer may experience symptoms such as a lump or mass in the breast, changes in the skin of the breast, pain in the breast, and nipple discharge. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial, as it can improve the chances of successful treatment. There are various methods for detecting breast cancer, including mammograms, breast ultrasounds, and breast biopsies. Women who are at high risk for breast cancer may be encouraged to undergo genetic testing to identify any potential genetic mutations that may increase their risk. Early detection of breast cancer can lead to successful treatment, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. </text>
